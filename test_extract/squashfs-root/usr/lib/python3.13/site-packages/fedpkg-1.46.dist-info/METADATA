Contribution
============

You are welcome to write patches to fix or improve rpkg. All code should work
with Python 3. Before you create a PR to propose your changes,
make sure

Sign-off commit
---------------

Make sure to sign-off your commits by ``git commit -s``. This serves as a
confirmation that you have the right to submit your changes. See `Developer
Certificate of Origin`_ for details.

.. _Developer Certificate of Origin: https://developercertificate.org/

Run Tests
---------

Before make a pull request, ensure local changes pass all test cases.

Before run tests, install these packages::

    sudo dnf install python36 python37 git make gcc rpm-build \
    libcurl-devel krb5-devel openssl-devel

To run tests simply, ``make test``.

By default, target ``test`` runs tests with all supported Python versions.
However, if you look into ``Makefile``, there is still a target ``tox`` that
allows developer to run tests with test environments one by one.
